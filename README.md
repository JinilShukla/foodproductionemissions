# foodproductionemissions
There were plenty of sources I had searched upon to find a suitable dataset for our project and the best fit to our objective built and collected by the Kaggle. This dataset which we have used has been put together by Kaggle and is available on:

# ARCHITECTURE OF THE MODEL:

# Input and output of the linear regression model:
I have built a simple linear regression model which predicts the total emissions made by the production of a particular food by only knowing the emissions made in Farm. I have made a model using Predictive learning strategy. The straight-line linear graph in the scatter plot represents that the data we have chosen for data mining is linearly related to the corresponding columns. 
# Input:
The total Farm Emissions in kcal is the input and the model will predict the total emissions (greenhouse gas emissions) by looking at the Farm emissions input.
# Output:
Learning from the initial data the model analyses and predicts the total emissions (greenhouse gas emissions) made by the food by looking at the Farm Emissions. The output will be total emissions (greenhouse gas emissions).
# EXPERIMENT:
The experiment is based on predicting the greenhouse gas emissions with respect to the Farm emissions occurred during the supply chains in food production. I considered data of two columns and made the data frames accordingly. I analysed this data and found it appropriate to use a Simple linear regression model. I divided the data provided in the data set into two parts. I took 70% of the data as training data and 30% of the data as the testing data. Then by training the model by the training I was able to create the regression line and then the testing data was used to predict the further results. Other than that I also used a statistical approach in which I categorized the total emissions made in the production of a particular food into different categories according to the food. From this experiment wI developed many results which can be used for the societal change.
